  abstract = {In a recent paper, Enayat and Le\lyk [2024] show that second order arithmetic and countable set theory are not definitionally equivalent. It is well known that these theories are biinterpretable. Thus, we have a pair of natural theories that llustrate a meaningful difference between definitional equivalence and bi-interpretability. This is particularly interesting given that Visser and Friedman [2014] have shown that a wide class of natural foundational theories in mathematics are such that if they are bi-interpretable, then they are also definitionally equivalent. The proof offered by Enayat and Le lyk makes use of an inaccessible cardinal. In this short note, we show that the failure of bi-interpretability can be established in Peano Arithmetic merely supposing that one of our target theories are consistent.},
